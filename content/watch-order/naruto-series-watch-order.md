Naruto is a series that I believe has gotten a little bit over criticized over the years in the anime community as of late it seems like the cool thing to hate on Naruto even I'm no stranger to throwing some shade at it here and there but believe it or not this show was part of my childhood and one of my favorite shows growing up however I think my perception of the show has been altered over the years due to the age of the Internet I've thought about you watching this show in particular part one for a while now I remember a lot of the main details like spoiler I guess but Sasuke leaves the village you know Sasuke is trying to kill his brother and some other major details may be but a lot of the details and sequence of events have completely been lost in memory I first watched the show back when I was 11 or 12 to put that into perspective as of January 6th I am 19 so yeah re-watch is a long time coming in this little series I'm just gonna be going over my thoughts.</p>
<p>
 I rewatched the show I won't be summarizing everything I'm just gonna be going over the things that stand out to me as I watch without any further ado let's get this started how does Naruto hold up young boy naruto? is shunned by everyone for something he's unaware of he's isolated nobody wants to be around him the only father figure he seems to have is Arouca he doesn't have the time to take care of him but still provides some tough love at the end of the episode, it was really touching to see Iruka give up his life to save Naruto he was the first person to believe in him but I found kind of offsetting or some could say hypocritical about this episode was how they portrayed Naruto as someone who wasn't very good at ninjutsu but then he was able to learn the shadow clones in just a few hours it seems speaking of clones this the whole replicating thing in the first the episode is confusing people being able to make clones of themselves is a the concept that's never revisited in the series.</p>
